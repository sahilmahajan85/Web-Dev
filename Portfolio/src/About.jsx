        <p>Hey! I’m a front-end developer with a strong focus on building clean, responsive, and user-centric web applications using React. I specialize in creating fast, accessible, and modern UIs that not only look good but also perform well across devices.
       <br /> 
       <br />
       I’ve worked on a variety of projects—ranging from simple landing pages to complex dashboards—using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and other modern web technologies. I care deeply about writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices for scalability and performance.
       <br />
       <br />
       I’m passionate about creating smooth user experiences. I pay attention to the details—from animations and transitions to accessibility and responsiveness. I believe that the best web experiences are intuitive, fast, and delightful.
       <br /><br />When I’m not coding, I’m probably learning something new in tech, exploring design trends, or contributing to personal projects. I'm always open to opportunities where I can grow, collaborate, and make an impact through front-end development.</p>
